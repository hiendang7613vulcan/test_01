> **Subject:** 📚 Psychology | **Difficulty:** ⚖️ beginner | **Source:** 📄 lecture | **Language:** 🌐 en


## 📝 Summary

This lesson focuses on the importance of recognizing and changing personal biases, especially in the context of therapy. Biases are like invisible filters that shape our perceptions and interactions, often without our awareness. The first step to change is acknowledging these biases and actively monitoring our communication to prevent them from influencing our behavior. Embracing diversity—valuing differences in people and lifestyles—broadens our understanding and helps us connect more deeply with clients. In therapy, maintaining a neutral environment is crucial. Therapists must avoid sharing or implying their own opinions, as clients are often vulnerable and easily influenced. Clear, concise communication is essential to prevent misunderstandings and ensure that clients feel understood and supported. By being aware of our biases and striving for neutrality, therapists can create a safe space for clients to explore their thoughts and feelings.

### 📌 Key Points
