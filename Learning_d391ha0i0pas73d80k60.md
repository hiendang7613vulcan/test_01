> **Subject:** 📚 Counseling/Psychology | **Difficulty:** ⚖️ beginner | **Source:** 📄 lecture | **Language:** 🌐 en


## 📝 Summary

This lesson focuses on the importance of recognizing and changing personal biases, especially in the context of therapy. Biases are like tinted glasses that affect how we see and interact with others, often without us realizing it. The first step to overcoming bias is self-awareness—actively noticing our own tendencies and reactions. By monitoring our communications and interactions, we can catch and correct biases before they affect others. Embracing diversity means valuing differences, which enriches our understanding and relationships. In therapy, maintaining a neutral environment is crucial; therapists must avoid sharing personal opinions or influencing clients, as this can hinder client progress. Clear, concise communication is essential to prevent misunderstandings, especially since clients may be vulnerable. These principles help create a supportive, unbiased space where clients can grow and heal.
