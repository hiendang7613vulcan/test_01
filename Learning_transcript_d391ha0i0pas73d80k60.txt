Lesson 16 continued. Changing biases. Making a conscious decision to understand and recognize your biases is the first step to change. From this point, you can monitor your communications and interactions to detect biases. This gives you the ability to modify how you communicate to others before you speak and to assess your perceptions and motivations. A constant awareness to bias will allow you to make positive interactions that consider all possibilities and differences that are appropriate to the situation. Embracing diversity and differences in individuals and lifestyles provides a point of reference and can show that differences are valid and contribute to creating depth and richness in society. This can help you to see client perspectives and provide client understanding. Your impact on the client. Understanding how you affect the client is important in your role as a therapist. Clients may have expectations of your role as a therapist which may or may not be correct. Communications should be clear and concise so that misinterpretations and misunderstandings are prevented. Your own personal opinions and preferences should not be disclosed or inferred to the client, although empathy and understanding can be a positive influence in assisting the client in their discussions. The client must be given a neutral environment. Your influence could sway the client and negatively affect their progress. It is important to remember that clients may be vulnerable or susceptible to other influences when in an emotional or traumatic position.
