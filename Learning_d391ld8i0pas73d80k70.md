> **Subject:** 📚 Professional Ethics | **Difficulty:** ⚖️ beginner | **Source:** 📄 lesson | **Language:** 🌐 en


## 📝 Summary

This lesson explores how personal values, beliefs, and behaviour shape professional practice, especially in clinical or workplace settings. Values are the core principles that guide what we find important, like honesty or punctuality. Beliefs are the things we accept as true, whether based on evidence, probability, or faith. Behaviour is how we act, particularly around others. Together, these elements influence how we interact with colleagues and clients. While positive values can enhance professional performance, problems arise when we impose our values or express divisive beliefs in the workplace. Such actions can lead to conflict, alienation, and even loss of clients or reputation. Professionals must be self-aware, respect others' differences, and maintain boundaries to ensure a healthy, effective work environment.
