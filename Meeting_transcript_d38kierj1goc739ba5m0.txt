1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:02
Speaker A:  Okay,

2
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
Speaker A:  leading change.

3
00:00:05 --> 00:00:10
Speaker A:  Give an example of when you led on change in a major organization.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:24
Speaker A:  Okay, so the situation that I was faced with was recently a decision had been made where Northern Ireland had to digitize its patient record.

5
00:00:25 --> 00:00:33
Speaker A:  This meant that originally we had to move from all legacy systems into one centralised system called InCompass.

6
00:00:34 --> 00:00:41
Speaker A:  The task at hand was that we were the first trust to go live in November 23.

7
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
Speaker A:  In the commencement of my current post as the Performance Manager,

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:50
Speaker A:  I had responsibility for our electronic.

9
00:00:51 --> 00:01:19
Speaker A:  system which was maximum therefore the onus I felt sat with me and my service to begin the readiness for this change coming in therefore I was tasked to help get mental health services ready for the implementation of encompass in November 2023 so about 18 months prior that then my work was set

10
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
Speaker A:  So what did I do to help bring in this change?

11
00:01:23 --> 00:01:30
Speaker A:  First and foremost was there was emails coming in left right and center about different people needing to sit on different groups.

12
00:01:31 --> 00:01:34
Speaker A:  This was mind-blowing and nobody really was keeping track.

13
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
Speaker A:  At this moment in time Encompass was like a myth across all our services.

14
00:01:41 --> 00:02:06
Speaker A:  Nobody could visualise what this actually meant but even before we could visualise we had to be able to understand what the system was going to deliver on and making sure that it was actually fit for purpose in delivering services that we were used to and accustomed to in our legacy systems and again not only that being a first trust life we had to be going in with original lines because other systems were at play.

15
00:02:08 --> 00:02:20
Speaker A:  Therefore the first thing I did was to obviously discuss with my manager about I feel I'm going to have to take on responsibility for this or be the champion to start moving this forward.

16
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
Speaker A:  I don't think anybody really estimated how long it was going to take.

17
00:02:26 --> 00:02:36
Speaker A:  I think a lot of people thought maybe a couple of months to bring it in and we're on the whole three years later but anyhow back to the task at hand and what I done. So first thing was I developed an oversight group.

18
00:02:37 --> 00:02:47
Speaker A:  I asked and I scoped everything that was required or what was going on at that time in relation to groups.

19
00:02:48 --> 00:03:15
Speaker A:  A lot of this was being fed through ADs and therefore it was to sit down with the AD at the time which was Damien Branigan and to say right show share with me what you're receiving start forwarding things to me and let me start making sense let me start enriching to the other stakeholders so this was at this point there was civic stamp being appointed across the trust not just with them in town across the trust and they were being professionally aligned so there would be a social worker nurse

20
00:03:15 --> 00:03:40
Speaker A:  i got my name out there i got introduced i met with them and wanted to say right tell me what your rules are and i would think that meant inviting them to already establish forms that would have been the managers meeting brought them into the managers meeting where um we got a sense of their roles and therefore how we would amalgamate and fit in with them i say this oversight group then i

21
00:03:41 --> 00:03:47
Speaker A:  started to create an agenda and was really focused on was let's get mental health ready

22
00:03:48 --> 00:04:15
Speaker A:  Actually that grew legs and actually the model we applied then was adopted across the whole trust and they brought in operational readiness groups with a very bespoke agenda which they copied or mimicked sorry they mimicked and we kindly agreed to share with them on things that we needed to be considered in order to get ready so without going into the details unconsciously time things the high header start would have been

23
00:04:17 --> 00:04:18
Speaker A:  Looking at staff,

24
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
Speaker A:  how we get them on, what do they need, their training,

25
00:04:22 --> 00:04:24
Speaker A:  their understanding,

26
00:04:24 --> 00:04:27
Speaker A:  how this would impact on their day-to-day business,

27
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
Speaker A:  what mobile devices would they need.

28
00:04:31 --> 00:04:34
Speaker A:  What policies and procedures were going to be impacted?

29
00:04:35 --> 00:04:46
Speaker A:  How were we going to start embedding this in people so this was bringing them in let's get into your team meetings let's get into supervision let's start talking in compass and that is what we done.

30
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
Speaker A:  From there then we were then to find well who was going to be the champions in each of their teams which became the super users.

31
00:04:53 --> 00:04:58
Speaker A:  So from there then was trying to develop that expertise also then that we needed people who knew.

32
00:04:59 --> 00:05:26
Speaker A:  what they were going to be delivering operationally and getting them into focus content design groups and this was really deciding what the service going to look like this then moved into decision groups so once we knew what how a service was going to look for example patient flow then it was looking at well then what are the decisions because these decisions needed to be taken regionally but again a lot of eyes were on us southeast trust

33
00:05:26 --> 00:05:46
Speaker A:  and how we were going to move that forward so really that was the first in relation to teams and support and this then was getting in into the teams and exploring with them the training so this was making sure and getting compliance that all the teams were there skills that I would have had to apply was obviously

34
00:05:47 --> 00:06:13
Speaker A:  um thinking about what what enables change and not one approach fits all so I needed to know how best were people going to learn how were these messages going to be disseminated down and applying compassion that change brings resistance and it was trying to bring people along a lot of people thought this was being forced upon them that they you know these decisions were made before nobody could really see how the benefit was going to be

35
00:06:15 --> 00:06:15
Speaker A:  And
