Its evolution reflects broader changes in Soviet military doctrine, organization, and the geopolitical context of the 20th century. The corps played roles in pre-World War II Soviet expansion, the Winter War, and major World War II battles, and underwent several postwar reorganizations, eventually becoming part of the Belarusian military.\n\n# Main Ideas and Concepts\n\n## First Formation (1938–1940)\n- **Origins and Structure:**\n  - Formed in May–June 1938 from the 7th Mechanized Corps, which relocated from Novy Petergof to Luga.\n  - Transitioned as part of the Red Army's shift from mechanized corps to tank corps structures.\n  - Included the 107th Separate Air Liaison Flight (formed August 1938), 13th and 1st Light Tank Brigades, and the 15th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade.\n\n- **Baltic Operations (1939):**\n  - Relocated to Pskov (Estonian border) and then to the Latvian border in September–October 1939.\n  - Purpose: To pressure Estonia and Latvia into signing mutual assistance treaties, allowing Soviet military bases in both countries.\n  - These movements were part of Soviet expansionist policy before World War II.\n\n- **Winter War (1939–1940):**\n  - By November 1939, moved to the Finnish border as part of the 7th Army.\n  - Participated in the Soviet invasion of Finland (Winter War), crossing the border on 30 November 1939.\n  - Advanced towards Vyborg, concentrated in Baboshino, and later pulled out of combat.\n  - Headquarters moved to Tomilla by 20 December 1939.\n  - Performance of large tank corps was deemed unsatisfactory; all such corps, including the 10th, were disbanded in January 1940 (order dated 17 January).\n  - Corps HQ used to form an army group under Dmitry Pavlov at Kingisepp.\n\n## Second Formation (1942–1945)\n- **Reformation and World War II Service:**\n  - Reformed in April 1942.\n  - Participated in the Battle of Kursk as part of the Steppe Front.\n  - Notable personnel: Fatyh Zaripovich Sharipov, awarded Hero of the Soviet Union while serving with the corps.\n  - Later assigned to the 5th Guards Tank Army.\n  - By April 1945 (Battle of Berlin), part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK).\n  - Composition at this time: 178th, 183rd, and 186th Tank Brigades, and the 11th Motor Rifle Brigade.\n  - Distinct from the 30th Tank Corps, which became the 10th Guards Tank Corps.\n\n## Postwar Transformations\n- **Organizational Changes:**\n  - Became the 10th Tank Division after World War II.\n  - Renamed the 34th Heavy Tank Division on 30 April 1957.\n  - Became the 34th Tank Division in March 1965.\n  - On 20 March 1992, transferred to Belarus after the Soviet Union's dissolution.\n  - Became the 34th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base under the North Western Operational Command.\n\n# Timeline Chart\n| Date/Period         | Event/Transformation                                   |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| May–June 1938      | Formation from 7th Mechanized Corps at Luga           |\n| Aug 1938           | 107th Separate Air Liaison Flight formed              |\n| Sep–Oct 1939       | Moves to Estonian and Latvian borders                 |\n| Oct 1939           | 1st Light Tank Brigade replaces 18th Light Tank Brigade|\n| Nov 1939           | Moves to Finnish border for Winter War                |\n| 30 Nov 1939        | Crosses into Finland (Winter War begins)              |\n| Dec 1939           | Advances toward Vyborg, then withdrawn                |\n| Jan 1940           | Disbanded; HQ forms army group under Pavlov           |\n| Apr 1942           | Reformed as 10th Tank Corps                           |\n| 1943               | Battle of Kursk (Steppe Front)                        |\n| 1945               | Battle of Berlin (RVGK)                               |\n| Post-1945          | Becomes 10th Tank Division                            |\n| 30 Apr 1957        | Becomes 34th Heavy Tank Division                      |\n| Mar 1965           | Becomes 34th Tank Division                            |\n| 20 Mar 1992        | Transferred to Belarus, becomes storage base          |\n\n# Significance\n- The 10th Tank Corps' history illustrates the Soviet military's adaptation to changing doctrines and the demands of modern warfare.\n- Its involvement in Baltic and Finnish operations highlights the Red Army's role in Soviet territorial expansion before World War II.\n- The corps' participation in major World War II battles, such as Kursk and Berlin, underscores its operational importance.\n- Postwar reorganizations reflect broader trends in Soviet and post-Soviet military restructuring, culminating in its transfer to Belarus after the USSR's collapse.\n\n# Conclusion\nThe 10th Tank Corps exemplifies the evolution of Soviet armored forces from pre-World War II expansionism, through the crucible of World War II, to Cold War and post-Soviet transformations. Its legacy is marked by both its battlefield contributions and its organizational adaptability.
