## Overview
The 10th Tank Corps was a significant armored formation of the Red Army, formed twice during its history. Its evolution reflects broader changes in Soviet military doctrine, organization, and the geopolitical context of the 20th century. The corps played roles in pre-World War II Soviet expansion, the Winter War, and major World War II battles, and underwent several postwar reorganizations, eventually becoming part of the Belarusian military.

# Main Ideas and Concepts

## First Formation (1938–1940)
- **Origins and Structure:**
  - Formed in May–June 1938 from the 7th Mechanized Corps, which relocated from Novy Petergof to Luga.
  - Transitioned as part of the Red Army's shift from mechanized corps to tank corps structures.
  - Included the 107th Separate Air Liaison Flight (formed August 1938), 13th and 1st Light Tank Brigades, and the 15th Motor Rifle and Machine Gun Brigade.

- **Baltic Operations (1939):**
  - Relocated to Pskov (Estonian border) and then to the Latvian border in September–October 1939.
  - Purpose: To pressure Estonia and Latvia into signing mutual assistance treaties, allowing Soviet military bases in both countries.
  - These movements were part of Soviet expansionist policy before World War II.

- **Winter War (1939–1940):**
  - By November 1939, moved to the Finnish border as part of the 7th Army.
  - Participated in the Soviet invasion of Finland (Winter War), crossing the border on 30 November 1939.
  - Advanced towards Vyborg, concentrated in Baboshino, and later pulled out of combat.
  - Headquarters moved to Tomilla by 20 December 1939.
  - Performance of large tank corps was deemed unsatisfactory; all such corps, including the 10th, were disbanded in January 1940 (order dated 17 January).
  - Corps HQ used to form an army group under Dmitry Pavlov at Kingisepp.

## Second Formation (1942–1945)
- **Reformation and World War II Service:**
  - Reformed in April 1942.
  - Participated in the Battle of Kursk as part of the Steppe Front.
  - Notable personnel: Fatyh Zaripovich Sharipov, awarded Hero of the Soviet Union while serving with the corps.
  - Later assigned to the 5th Guards Tank Army.
  - By April 1945 (Battle of Berlin), part of the Reserve of the Supreme High Command (RVGK).
  - Composition at this time: 178th, 183rd, and 186th Tank Brigades, and the 11th Motor Rifle Brigade.
  - Distinct from the 30th Tank Corps, which became the 10th Guards Tank Corps.

## Postwar Transformations
- **Organizational Changes:**
  - Became the 10th Tank Division after World War II.
  - Renamed the 34th Heavy Tank Division on 30 April 1957.
  - Became the 34th Tank Division in March 1965.
  - On 20 March 1992, transferred to Belarus after the Soviet Union's dissolution.
  - Became the 34th Weapons and Equipment Storage Base under the North Western Operational Command.

# Significance
- The 10th Tank Corps' history illustrates the Soviet military's adaptation to changing doctrines and the demands of modern warfare.
- Its involvement in Baltic and Finnish operations highlights the Red Army's role in Soviet territorial expansion before World War II.
- The corps' participation in major World War II battles, such as Kursk and Berlin, underscores its operational importance.
- Postwar reorganizations reflect broader trends in Soviet and post-Soviet military restructuring, culminating in its transfer to Belarus after the USSR's collapse.

# Conclusion
The 10th Tank Corps exemplifies the evolution of Soviet armored forces from pre-World War II expansionism, through the crucible of World War II, to Cold War and post-Soviet transformations. Its legacy is marked by both its battlefield contributions and its organizational adaptability.
