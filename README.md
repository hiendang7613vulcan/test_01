## 🗺️ Overview
The Vietnam War (1 November 1955 – 30 April 1975) was a major conflict in Southeast Asia, primarily fought in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. It pitted North Vietnam and its communist allies (the Soviet Union, China, and the Viet Cong) against South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist nations. The war was a central theater of the Cold War, marked by ideological, political, and military struggles, and resulted in the reunification of Vietnam under communist control.

## 🏛️ Background and Origins
### 1. French Colonialism and Nationalist Movements
- Vietnam was part of French Indochina from the 1880s, facing growing nationalist and communist resistance.
- The Indochinese Communist Party (ICP), founded by Ho Chi Minh in 1930, sought to overthrow French rule and establish a communist state.

### 2. Japanese Occupation and World War II
- Japan occupied Indochina during WWII, allowing the Viet Minh (led by Ho Chi Minh) to gain strength with Allied support.
- After Japan's surrender, the Viet Minh declared independence, but French and British forces reasserted control in the south.

### 3. First Indochina War and Geneva Accords
- The Viet Minh defeated the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, leading to the Geneva Accords.
- Vietnam was temporarily divided at the 17th parallel, with elections planned (but never held) for reunification.

## ⚔️ Escalation and Major Phases
### 1. Early South Vietnam and Diệm Era (1954–63)
- Ngô Đình Diệm, backed by the U.S., became president of South Vietnam, suppressing opposition and launching anti-communist campaigns.
- Land reforms and political repression fueled resentment and insurgency, leading to the formation of the Viet Cong (VC).

### 2. U.S. Involvement and Escalation (1963–69)
- After Diệm's assassination in 1963, South Vietnam entered political instability.
- The Gulf of Tonkin incident (1964) led to direct U.S. military intervention, including massive troop deployments and bombing campaigns (Operation Rolling Thunder).
- The war expanded into Laos and Cambodia, with the U.S. supporting allied governments and conducting covert operations.

### 3. Tet Offensive and Aftermath (1968)
- The Tet Offensive (January 1968) was a large-scale attack by North Vietnamese and VC forces on over 100 cities.
- Although a military setback for the communists, it shocked U.S. public opinion and eroded support for the war.
- Leadership changes followed, with General Westmoreland replaced and President Johnson declining to seek re-election.

### 4. Vietnamization and U.S. Withdrawal (1969–73)
- President Nixon initiated "Vietnamization," shifting combat roles to the ARVN and gradually withdrawing U.S. troops.
- Peace negotiations in Paris led to the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, ending direct U.S. involvement but not the conflict.
- The war continued between North and South Vietnam, with the U.S. providing limited support.

### 5. Final Campaigns and Fall of Saigon (1973–75)
- North Vietnam launched major offensives, culminating in the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975.
- Vietnam was reunified under communist rule in 1976.
