## Overview
The 10th Tank Corps was a significant armored formation of the Red Army, formed twice during its history. Its evolution reflects broader changes in Soviet military doctrine, organization, and the geopolitical context of the 20th century. The corps played roles in pre-World War II Soviet expansion, the Winter War, and major World War II battles, and underwent several postwar reorganizations, eventually becoming part of the Belarusian military.
