Speaker 1: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank you all for taking a look at this and your support for this measure. This is going to help a lot of people in the community of Long Beach and hopefully the community as a whole. We do know that the. It just shows from the report out from your own city workers. Understaffing is a chronic issue among all the folks that take care of our city. Health care is just one of many of many examples. We all work long hours, short staffed, and we're taking care of our most vulnerable citizens. And that's why, again, I'd like to thank you for bringing up this matter. And I would definitely hope that you will vote in the affirmative to support a $25 minimum wage for health care workers. And hopefully this will have effects on other workers here in the city and statewide. Thank you.
Speaker 4: A speaker, please.

I just want to know that everybody gonna think different. Hear me yell. Um. I'm sorry. I congratulate you. Thank you. For how much? This means a lot to us for getting this wage going up for us, because a lot of people struggle in general just in their life and with their lives and having with the rent crisis situation and inflation. We also care and help people in need patients in the hospital because it's really short stuff at the moment. We don't have them there, so we short the nurses every single day. Staffing in general. And. Thank you for your support and hopefully you can pass a bill to give more aid and and especially in hospitals throughout the community because we are really short staffed as or she's a very overcrowded and we can't even take care of the people that come for help. So and dinner and stuff and other people are leaving also because again. Just wait the wages. There is not enough for them. So I appreciate you guys. I continue to take the field consideration.
