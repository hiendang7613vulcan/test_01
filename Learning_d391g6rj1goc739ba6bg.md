## 📖 Concepts & Definitions

### 🔹 PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome)

**Definition:** A hormonal disorder causing enlarged ovaries with small cysts on the outer edges. It often leads to irregular periods, excess hair growth, acne, and weight gain. PCOS is a common cause of infertility in women.

**Analogy:** It's like a traffic jam in your ovaries—eggs can't get out smoothly, causing delays and problems.

**Examples:** Irregular or missed periods; Unexplained weight gain; Difficulty getting pregnant

**Common Pitfalls / Non-examples:** Assuming all women with irregular periods have PCOS; Thinking PCOS always causes infertility


### 🔹 Fertility

**Definition:** The natural ability to conceive children. In women, fertility depends on healthy ovulation, hormone balance, and reproductive organs.

**Analogy:** It's like planting seeds in a garden—if the soil, water, and sunlight aren't right, seeds won't grow.

**Examples:** A woman becoming pregnant after regular cycles; Difficulty conceiving due to hormonal imbalance

**Common Pitfalls / Non-examples:** Assuming fertility is only a woman's issue; Believing age doesn't affect fertility


### 🔹 Lifestyle Modification

**Definition:** Changes in daily habits such as diet, exercise, sleep, and stress management to improve health outcomes, especially for chronic conditions like PCOS.

**Analogy:** It's like tuning up a car—regular maintenance keeps everything running smoothly.

**Examples:** Eating a balanced diet; Getting enough sleep; Managing stress

**Common Pitfalls / Non-examples:** Relying only on medication without changing habits


### 🔹 Support System

**Definition:** A network of people who provide emotional, practical, or informational help during difficult times.
