1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:15
Speaker A:  Yeah, this was my notes from the meeting with Kira Craig from Upwardly Global.

2
00:00:16 --> 00:00:25
Speaker A:  My name is Daniel and I'm a senior workforce development advisor and program officer for Mission Hiring Hall.

3
00:00:25 --> 00:00:29
Speaker A:  Today's date is 9-22-2025.

4
00:00:31 --> 00:00:38
Speaker A:  Kira and I had about an hour conversation about ways to find synergy with upwardly global.

5
00:00:39 --> 00:00:53
Speaker A:  We've had several students in the past that used upwardly global to help find a marketplace after being professionals in foreign countries but having a challenge assimilating.

6
00:00:53 --> 00:01:01
Speaker A:  Their skills in education overseas with the job market here locally in San Francisco.

7
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
Speaker A:  We discussed an overview of the CAPSA program and background,

8
00:01:08 --> 00:01:09
Speaker A:  my background,

9
00:01:09 --> 00:01:10
Speaker A:  and

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:13
Speaker A:  how I

11
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Speaker A:  felt the population that Upper Big Global looks to.

12
00:01:19 --> 00:01:39
Speaker A:  Surf is in many ways like the population that we encounter that are looking to take CAPSA and find both upskilling and assistance in converting to the American workplace.

13
00:01:41 --> 00:01:46
Speaker A:  I went into detail about how CAPSA

14
00:01:47 --> 00:01:59
Speaker A:  creates an employment narrative, identifies transferrable skills and builds new skills through its programming and construction administration and management.

15
00:02:03 --> 00:02:07
Speaker A:  Kira introduced herself and her familiarity with WIAWA funds,

16
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
Speaker A:  although she is working remotely from Charlotte.

17
00:02:13 --> 00:02:21
Speaker A:  It doesn't have a great deal of experience in the Bay Area specific market and demographics.

18
00:02:23 --> 00:02:34
Speaker A:  Kira talked a lot about synergy around what upwardly global does in terms of providing job

19
00:02:35 --> 00:02:36
Speaker A:  support,

20
00:02:36 --> 00:02:37
Speaker A:  job search support.

21
00:02:38 --> 00:02:43
Speaker A:  And what she called many workshops,

22
00:02:44 --> 00:02:46
Speaker A:  15 minutes or so,

23
00:02:46 --> 00:02:51
Speaker A:  and had a curricular approach that was an online platform.

24
00:02:57 --> 00:02:58
Speaker A:  All very good.

25
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Speaker A:  What I wanted to understand that as I thought the...

26
00:03:05 --> 00:03:28
Speaker A:  Crucial synergy really was between the two organizations having a cross referral basis and that she could refer graduates and program participants at upwardly global to CAPSA program and

27
00:03:29 --> 00:03:31
Speaker A:  how I could refer international students.

28
00:03:35 --> 00:03:41
Speaker A:  that may be in capsule or that we may not be able to have

29
00:03:42 --> 00:03:55
Speaker A:  in the program as we have over 400 interested parties and 25 slots open per six month semester at City College.

30
00:04:00 --> 00:04:03
Speaker A:  We ended with a follow-up that would involve

31
00:04:04 --> 00:04:20
Speaker A:  A demo she would send me and some potential ability to cross-refer and broaden both our recruitment and outreach at mission hiring all caps a program as well as find

32
00:04:22 --> 00:04:29
Speaker A:  participants that would be eligible as well for upwardly globals programming.

33
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
Speaker A:  Which may be interesting because they have ways they can pay for some OSHA certification,

34
00:04:37 --> 00:04:39
Speaker A:  Salesforce,

35
00:04:40 --> 00:04:42
Speaker A:  and perhaps even Microsoft training.

36
00:04:43 --> 00:04:54
Speaker A:  So those would be certifications we could look for them to pay for as being.

37
00:04:55 --> 00:04:57
Speaker A:  referrals part of their program.

38
00:04:59 --> 00:05:15
Speaker A:  In summation there is synergy and cross referral potential and I'll look out for my email from Kira this week and set up another time for a phone call after I go through her information I will also send in a program overview to Kira.
